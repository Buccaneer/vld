# Visual Leak Detector 

## This personal fork

I maintain this fork to be used by students at [Hogeschool West-Vlaanderen in the bachelor Digital Artes and Entertainment](https://www.digitalartsandentertainment.be/). It is created to keep the vld project up to date with the latest visual studio versions and the latest installer tools. We merge all changes applied to the original Azure fork into this one. Please refer to [https://github.com/Azure/vld](https://github.com/Azure/vld) for the original version.
